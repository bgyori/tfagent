Our database currently include:
1) TF regulation data has been collected from multiple databases.
It combines the following datasets into one:

    TRED (2007)
    ITFP (2008)
    ENCODE (2012)
    Neph2012 (2012)
    TRRUST (2015)
    Marbach2016 (2016)
    
2) pathway databases
It includes 7 pathway databases: KEGG, Wikipathways, BioCarta, Reactome, HumanCyc, PharmGKB, SMPDB

3) Gene Ontology database
Currently use MSigDB.

4) MirRNA database
It's based on miRTarBase 7.0.

5)Tissue specific gene expression
It's based on Tiger dataset.
