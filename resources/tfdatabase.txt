Our database currently include:
1) TF regulation data has been collected from multiple databases.
It combines the following datasets into one:

    TRED (2007)
    ITFP (2008)
    ENCODE (2012)
    Neph2012 (2012)
    TRRUST (2015)
    Marbach2016 (2016)
    
The data can be find at https://github.com/slowkow/tftargets. But we further refined the data.
    
2) pathway databases
It includes 7 pathway databases: KEGG, Wikipathways, BioCarta, Reactome, HumanCyc, PharmGKB, SMPDB

3) Gene Ontology database
Currently use MSigDB and refined GO categories.

4) MicroRNA database
It's based on miRTarBase 7.0 at http://mirtarbase.mbc.nctu.edu.tw/php/index.php

5)Tissue specific gene expression
It's based on Tiger dataset at http://bioinfo.wilmer.jhu.edu/tiger/

6)Tissue specific gene regulation
It's based on Tiger dataset and Neph2012, as well as literature search.

7) kinase regulation
It's based on enrichr (http://amp.pharm.mssm.edu/Enrichr/#stats)
